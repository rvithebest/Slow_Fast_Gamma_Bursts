# Differential Burst dynamics of Slow and Fast gamma rhythms in Macaque V1
- Computed burst durations of slow and fast gamma (stimulus induced) produced in LFP recorded from V1 of two awake adult feamle monkeys
- Employed MP, OMP-GEAR, and HT to estimate burst durations
- Measured functional connectivity (PLV and WPLI) across all pair of electrodes
- Used WC network model (firing-rate) to simulate bursty slow and fast gamma rhythms
- For further details refer to:
## Results
- Slow gamma rhythm exhibited significantly longer burst durations and longer latencies as compared to fast gamma.
- Slow gamma exhibited higher long-range synchrony compared to fast gamma.
- Results were consistent across different burst estimators.
- Simply changing the firing-rate time-constant of the corresponding inhibitory interneuronal population in the noisy WC model, leads to both slower and longer bursts.
